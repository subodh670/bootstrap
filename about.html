	<p><h1>Leaning Tower of Pisa opening times
The Pisa attractions are open all year round though opening hours are quite complex and seasonal.

 

The Leaning Tower has variable opening times depending on the time of year. From April to June it is 9am to 8pm, from June to September it is 8.30am to 10pm.

 

Shorter opening hours are in the winter season.

 

The other attractions are also open at similar times. For the full opening times, go to the official website linked at the top of the page.

 

Piazza dei Miracoli (Miracle Square)
The Leaning Tower is the third oldest building on Piazza dei Miracoli; the Cathedral and Baptistery were first.

 

Much of the Piazza dei Miracoli is grassed over with walkways between the main monuments in the middle of the Piazza. Around the edge of the Piazza are museums, a visitor centre and ticket offices. There is also a left luggage facility.

 

The streets around Piazza dei Miracoli are full of restaurants.
